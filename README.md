# Data-Science-Introduction, A Broad Overview

This a slideshow presentation which I have used to give an overview of Data Science, from the types of data all the way to how data scientists run computational experiments to choose and refine their models.

The slideshow can be viewed online [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/max-torch/Data-Science-Introduction/blob/main/Presentation.slides.html#/) using nbviewer.
